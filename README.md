# Pythagorean-Triplets
Three positive integers a, b, and c with a < b < c form a Pythagorean triplet if a2 + b2 = c2 . For example, 3, 4, and 5 form a Pythagorean triplet since 32 + 42 = 52. Write a program that first prompts the user for a positive integer and then finds and prints all Pythagorean triplets whose largest member is less than or equal to that integer.
